This project is a Telephone Number Formatter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simple and interactive UI that allows users to input a phone number, which is then formatted in real-time to follow a standardized format. The app enhances data entry by enforcing formatting rules, improving user experience and input validation. This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and clean UI designâ€”ideal for learning front-end input handling and formatting logic.
